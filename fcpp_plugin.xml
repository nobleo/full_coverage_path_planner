      Plans a path that covers all accessible points in a costmap by using Boustrophedon-STC (Spanning Tree Coverage).
      In essence, the robot moves forward until an obstacle or visited node is met, then turns right or left (making a boustrophedon pattern)
      When stuck while completing a boustrophedon pattern, use A* to get out again and start a new boustrophedon, until A* can't find a path to uncovered cells
